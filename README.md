# Fontmake vs Glyphsapp for ttf generation

Research is being conducted on behalf of the Google Fonts project. 

A high level comparison document is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z-s5ai9fKabHtzIaWVdsHTXyJy175fvdhqsuKQh5JIY/edit). Please note: fontmake is still under active development. The document will be updated as fontmake improves.


## Generate ttx files
    gen_ttx.sh

Outputs generated ttf's and ttx files into fontmake_gen and glyphs_gen, depending on which generation approach was used.
